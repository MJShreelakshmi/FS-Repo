    "Jinja tagging is an advanced level of writing tags in html files\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja tags are also known as Expression tags or Template tags\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification of Jinja tags\n",
    "Based on the operation we are doing with Jinja tags, they are classified into 2 types:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Tags are used for printing the data which is sent from Backend to Frontend\n",
    "        2. Tags that are used for performing some operations\n",
    "#### 1. Tags used for printing the data\n",
    "By using thsus type of tags, we can render some content from Backend and represent the same rendered data in the webpage\n",
    "#### Representation of Jinja tags which is used for printing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "            {{ keyname }}\n",
    "#### Procedure\n",
    "1. Go to html file, represent jinja tags as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "       Syntax:     {{ variable_name }} or {{ key_name }}\n",
    "       Example:    {{ age }}\n",
    "2. Go to views.py, create a dictionary inside the function and pass it as value for the context attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "       Syntax:\n",
    "                   def function_name( request ):\n",
