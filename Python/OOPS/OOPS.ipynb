    "## OOPS - Object Oriented Programming Structure/System\n",
    "1. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "    A paradigm is a standard, perspective or set of ideas.\n",
    "2. It supports both functional and OOPS for solving programming problems\n",
    "3. One of the most popular approach for solving programming problems is by creating objects. This  is known as Object Orienetd Programming\n",
    "4. In OOPS, every real time entity is treated as on object. An object has 2 characteristics: 1. States(Properties)  2. Behaviour (Functionalities)\n",
    "5. Logically, an object is a combination of states and behaviours\n",
    "6. To create an object, we need design\n",
    "7. Class is a design/prototype or template of an object\n",
    "8. From one class, we can create multiple objects\n",
    "9. Using Encapsulation in OOPS, we can provide data security\n",
    "10. Using Abstraction, we can hide the unnecessary details from the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of creating an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A parrot is an object, it has following properties:\n",
    "        1. Name, Age, Color - Properties\n",
    "        2. Singing and Dancing - Behaviour\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### The concept of OOPS in python focuses on reusability of code. This concept is also known as DRY (Donot Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process of OOPS\n",
    "1. Creation of a class (blueprint) --> design/ templete/ prototype of an object\n",
    "2. Create the objects from the class (blueprint)\n",
    "3. Use that created object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important terms in OOPS\n",
    "1. Class    --> Blue print of an object\n",
    "2. Object   --> Entity which has states(properties) and behaviours (Object --> A Real world entity)\n",
    "3. Instance --> Defining the states of an Object(Current Object; Objects can be multiple at a time but we can have only one instance at a time)\n",
    "4. Methods  --> Defining the behaviours of an Object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important concepts in OOPS\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Binding the properties and Functionalities of an Object under one roof\n",
    "2. Aggregation: It is the process of creating/using of any object of one class in another class\n",
    "3. Inheritence: Acquiring the properties of one class into another class\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: One method behaving in different ways\n",
    "5. Abstraction: Hiding the internal functionalities of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process of OOPS\n",
    "I) Creating a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "        \n",
    "            class ClassName:   or className():\n",
    "                \n",
    "                states\n",
    "                .\n",
    "                .\n",
    "                \n",
    "                behaviours\n",
    "                .\n",
    "                .\n",
    "                . . . . . .\n",
    "The process occuring in the memory once a class is created:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A dictionary will get created under the className\n",
    "2. States and behaviours names are considered as keys and their values as values in the dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "II) Creating an Object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ObjectName = ClassName()\n",
    "The process occuring in the memory once we create an object:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A dictionary will get created under the ObjectName\n",
    "2. Derives all the Class Dictionary properties into Object Dictionary\n",
    "3. Checks for the constructor, if it is available, it will be called\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### States\n",
    "1. States are the properties (information) of the objects\n",
    "2. By using variables, we can define the states of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification of states of an Object\n",
    "States of an object are classified into 2 types:\n",
    "1. Generic properties(information) of an Object\n",
    "2. Specific properties (information) of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generic properties(information)\n",
    "1. These are the common properties of all the objects\n",
    "2. Values for generic properties will not change from object to object\n",
    "3. Generic Properties are defined by using class variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Variable\n",
    "Class variables are those variables which are defined inside the class and outside the method\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: Every class is a data type for its object"
